## just: add porcelain to your plumbing

I'm sensing a good way to work with just.
Write scripts, add them to bin directory.
Call them from just.

It may seem like overkill at first.
It adds consistency to the project.
I can go into any folder and type `just`.
It will print out the main commands I need to know.
I don't need a README just to get going.

Comes from the git idea of plumbing and porcelain.

## Thinkpad E495

I really like it so far.
The only thing I don't like is the screen isn't bright enough for me.
I don't know if that's a limitation of the screen, or if FreeBSD isn't configured correctly.
I believe I have it at 100% brightness, and it's just a tad dim.
Everything else works great so far though, so I will most likely keep it.
I wonder if it's possible to get a new panel?
Also I need to figure out how to disable / soften the beep.
It's loud and stupid.

## git commit prefix

The FreeBSD monorepos use a prefix to indicate which subsystem a commit refers to.
I've been doing the same thing with my monorepo.
I wonder if I could script it?
