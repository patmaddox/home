## just: add porcelain to your plumbing

I'm sensing a good way to work with just.
Write scripts, add them to bin directory.
Call them from just.

It may seem like overkill at first.
It adds consistency to the project.
I can go into any folder and type `just`.
It will print out the main commands I need to know.
I don't need a README just to get going.

Comes from the git idea of plumbing and porcelain.
